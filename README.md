# Comparable & Equatable for PHP

This library provides two simple interfaces:
 * **Comparable**: Implemented by objects that desire to adjust how they should be compared to other objects.
 * **Equatable**: Implemented by objects that desire to adjust how they should be equated to other objects.

For more in-depth information see the phpDoc in the interfaces themselves.
